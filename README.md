# HPC Cheatsheet

Welcome to the HPC Cheatsheet repository, a collection of resources for installing and using various artificial intelligence frameworks on HPC systems. Our goal is to provide step-by-step guides that cover all possible scenarios, as well as open up the repository for collaboration, editing and sharing.

## Installation Guides

Our installation guides are designed to walk you through the process of installing various AI frameworks on your HPC system, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet. We have provided detailed instructions for different operating systems and HPC architectures, and we aim to make the process as user-friendly as possible.

### TensorFlow

- [Installing TensorFlow on Ubuntu 18.04](installation-guides/tensorflow/ubuntu-18.04.md)
- [Installing TensorFlow on CentOS 7](installation-guides/tensorflow/centos-7.md)

### PyTorch

- [Installing PyTorch on Ubuntu 18.04](installation-guides/pytorch/ubuntu-18.04.md)
- [Installing PyTorch on CentOS 7](installation-guides/pytorch/centos-7.md)

### MXNet

- [Installing MXNet on Ubuntu 18.04](installation-guides/mxnet/ubuntu-18.04.md)
- [Installing MXNet on CentOS 7](installation-guides/mxnet/centos-7.md)

## Usage Guides

Our usage guides cover how to use the installed AI frameworks on your HPC system, including how to run sample programs and how to tune your model to optimize performance. We also provide tips and tricks for troubleshooting common problems you may encounter during the usage of these frameworks.
